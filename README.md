This is a repository where I store my practice landing pages that I have created using HTML and CSS. It is a collection of landing page templates that I've created to improve my web development skills.

Each landing page is stored in its own folder and includes all the necessary HTML, CSS, and image files. The files are well-organized and easy to understand, making it simple for me to store and retrieve the landing pages I have created.

By keeping all my practice landing pages in one place, I can easily access them for future reference and use them to build on my web development knowledge. This repository serves as a record of my progress and a place to showcase my work.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn more about web development or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, this repository can be a valuable resource. Explore the collection of landing pages, review the code, and continue to improve your web development abilities.
